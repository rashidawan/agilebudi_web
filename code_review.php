            	<p>We help our clients in conducting code reviews and thus save them from engaging additional resources in fixing the coding problems.<br>
<br>
With our pragmatic approach, we help in identifying common software bugs, errors, functional problems and range limits as well as potential problems including usability issues, security problems and performance issues. With our comprehensible methodology we help our clients in maintaining the code and thus improving the quality of their software applications.<br>
<br>
We perform code reviews to save time by identifying defects before they become a problem for other components of the application code and become expensive to trace and rectify. During code reviews we also highlight improvement in coding practices as well as unnecessary features or features that donâ€™t match the requirements.
